# Artificial Intelligence Algorithms

A classification problem. I try to solve it with:
   1. Naive Bayes
   2. Decision Tree
   3. Random Forest
   4. Neural Network (a very simple configuration).
   
You can find here a very simple examples os Artificial Intelligence algorithms.
Three of them are machine learning algoritmh nd the last one is a deep learning algoritm. 

I hope you can enjoy it!
